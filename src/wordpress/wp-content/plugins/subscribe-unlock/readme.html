<h3>Intro</h3>
<p><strong>Subscribe To Unlock Content</strong> is a plugin that allows to lock important content on your WordPress website and display it for subscribed users only. All you need to do is to wrap protected content with shortcodes <code>[subscribelocker]...[/subscribelocker]</code>. If people want to view this content they must submit their contact details.
